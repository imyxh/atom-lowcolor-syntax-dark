## future:

- [ ] tidy up formatting for:
  - [ ] Bash
  - [ ] CSS/LESS
  - [ ] HTML
    [ ] Ruby
    [ ] C
    [ ] JavaScript

- [ ] expand to other programs:
  - [ ] vim
  - [ ] zsh

- [ ] ???
  - [ ] profit!


## 0.3.0:

- [ ] consider just overlaying this theme on top of atom-syntax-dark to make more sense, like it was originally

- [x] add a bit of padding left of the code and right of the line numbers (nope; where does the line begin?)

- [ ] gutter is unnecessarily wide, see if there's a way to shrink it

- [ ] add configurations to the theme, e.g. accessibility and an easy way to pick the two main colors themselves


## (DONE) 0.2.0:

- [x] update weight of:
  - [x] line numbers
  - [x] invisible characters
  - [x] decorators (put on hold for now until I sort out that third color proposal)
  - [x] docstrings, maybe (nah I think they look fine)


- [x] lighten and desaturate colors

- [x] color-blind accessibility options

- [x] create changelog based on this file

- [x] start changing CSS colors of attributes and property values
